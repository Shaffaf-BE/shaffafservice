# SELLER-BASED UNION MEMBER FILTERING IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview

Implemented role-based access control for Union Member APIs to ensure sellers can only access union members from projects they own, while admins retain full access.

## Problem

Previously, both admins and sellers had unrestricted access to all union members across all projects. This violated data security principles as sellers should only see union members from their own projects.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Service Layer

#### New Service Methods

Added seller-aware methods to `UnionMemberService` interface:

```java
/**
 * Get all union members for a specific project with seller filtering.
 */
Page<UnionMemberDTO> findUnionMembersByProjectNativeFiltered(Long projectId, Pageable pageable, String currentUserLogin);

/**
 * Get all union members with seller filtering.
 */
Page<UnionMemberDTO> findAllUnionMembersNativeFiltered(Pageable pageable, String currentUserLogin);

```

#### Implementation Logic

In `UnionMemberServiceImpl`:

1. **Role Detection**: Uses `SecurityUtils.hasCurrentUserThisAuthority(AuthoritiesConstants.SELLER)` to detect seller users
2. **Seller Lookup**: Finds seller by phone number using `sellerRepository.findByPhoneNumber(currentUserLogin)`
3. **Project Ownership Validation**: For project-specific queries, validates seller owns the requested project
4. **Data Filtering**: Uses seller-specific repository queries to return only relevant union members

### 2. Enhanced Repository Layer

#### New Repository Methods

Added to `UnionMemberRepository`:

```java
/**
 * Check if a project is owned by a specific seller.
 */
boolean isProjectOwnedBySeller(@Param("projectId") Long projectId, @Param("sellerId") Long sellerId);

/**
 * Find all union members by seller's projects using native SQL.
 */
Page<Object[]> findAllUnionMembersNativeBySellerProjects(
  @Param("sellerId") Long sellerId,
  @Param("sortBy") String sortBy,
  @Param("sortDirection") String sortDirection,
  Pageable pageable
);

```

#### SQL Implementation

- **Project Ownership Check**: Verifies `project.seller_id = :sellerId`
- **Union Member Filtering**: Uses `INNER JOIN` with project table to filter by seller ownership
- **Soft Delete Awareness**: Excludes deleted projects and union members

### 3. Updated Controller Layer

#### Enhanced Endpoints

**getUnionMembersByProject** (`/api/union-members/v1/project/{projectId}`):

- Now validates seller has access to the specific project
- Returns 400 Bad Request with "accessdenied" error key if unauthorized
- Admins retain unrestricted access

**getAllUnionMembersNative** (`/api/union-members/v1/native`):

- Sellers see only union members from their owned projects
- Admins see all union members across all projects
- Maintains pagination and sorting functionality

### 4. Security Implementation

#### Authorization Flow

1. **Authentication**: Extract current user login from security context
2. **Role Check**: Determine if user is SELLER or ADMIN
3. **Seller Validation**: For sellers, lookup seller record by phone number
4. **Access Control**: Apply appropriate filtering based on role
5. **Error Handling**: Return user-friendly error messages for access violations

#### Error Scenarios

- **Seller Not Found**: Returns "Seller not found" error
- **Unauthorized Project Access**: Returns "Access denied: You don't have permission to view union members for this project"
- **Invalid Authentication**: Returns "Current user login not found"

### 🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION

The implementation is **production-ready** with the following features:

1. **Secure Access Control**: Sellers can only access their own project data
2. **Efficient Bulk Operations**: Create multiple units, blocks, and unit types in single API call
3. **Data Integrity**: JPA sequence generation and referential integrity maintained
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages and validation feedback
5. **Scalable**: Reasonable limits and efficient database operations
6. **Well-Tested**: Comprehensive unit test coverage

### 📋 API ENDPOINTS SUMMARY

**Union Member Filtering (Enhanced):**

- `GET /api/union-members/project/{projectId}` - Project-specific union members (seller-filtered)
- `GET /api/union-members/native` - All union members (seller-filtered)

**Bulk Unit Creation (New):**

- `POST /api/bulk-unit-creation/v1/units` - Create blocks, unit types, and units in bulk

Both endpoints respect seller-based access control and provide admin override functionality.

### 🔧 DEPLOYMENT NOTES

1. Ensure database schema supports the existing Block, UnitType, Unit, and Project relationships
2. Verify seller authentication is configured to use phone numbers
3. Confirm role-based security is enabled (ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_SELLER)
4. Test API endpoints in staging environment before production deployment
5. Monitor performance for large bulk creation requests (>100 units)
